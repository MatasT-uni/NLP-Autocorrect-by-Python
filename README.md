## Autocorrect System using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on implementing an Autocorrect system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to correct misspelled words in a text input by comparing them against a predefined vocabulary and selecting the most likely correct word based on distance metrics and probability models.

## Project Overview

This project is structured as an assignment to understand the core concepts of an Autocorrect system in the context of natural language processing (NLP). The task is to correct spelling errors in text input by finding the closest word in a predefined vocabulary based on edit distance and probability.

## Key Objectives

- **Word Matching**: Identify the closest correct word from a vocabulary based on the input word.
- **Distance Metrics**: Use distance metrics like Edit Distance to evaluate the similarity between words.
- **Probability-Based Corrections**: Implement probability-based methods to suggest the most likely correct word.
- **Efficient Implementation**: Design the system to handle common spelling errors and correct them efficiently.

## Notebook Structure

### Part 1: Preprocessing the Text

- **Vocabulary Setup**: Load and preprocess the vocabulary to be used for comparison with input words.

### Part 2: Implementing Edit Distance

- **Edit Distance Calculation**: Implement the edit distance algorithm to measure how dissimilar two words are.

### Part 3: Probability Calculation

- **Word Probability**: Calculate the probability of each word in the vocabulary based on its frequency in a corpus.

### Part 4: Autocorrect Function

- **Correcting Words**: Implement the autocorrect function that uses the edit distance and word probability to correct misspelled words.

### Part 5: Testing the Autocorrect System

- **Model Testing**: Test the autocorrect function on various text inputs to evaluate its performance.

### Part 6: Error Analysis

- **Analyzing Errors**: Review cases where the autocorrect system failed to correct words correctly to understand potential areas for improvement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the `.ipynb` file or explore the `.html` output.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository link]
   cd [repository folder]
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook or the HTML file and run all cells to see the implementation of the Autocorrect system.

## Usage

- **Run the notebook** to see the step-by-step implementation of the Autocorrect system.
- **Use the implemented functions** to correct misspelled words in your own text inputs.
- **Analyze errors** by reviewing cases where the system made incorrect corrections to identify areas for potential improvement.

## Results

The project demonstrates the process of building an Autocorrect system using Naive Bayes and edit distance metrics. Through this process, the accuracy and effectiveness of the system can be evaluated, and insights into its behavior can be gained through error analysis.
